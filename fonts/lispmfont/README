M.I.T. "CADR LispMachine" main console font
( Original name = CPTFONT
  CPT = Character Printing Terminal = capable of displaying
  whole characters, but not individual pixels )


Instructions for the Linux console
----------------------------------

Just type

$ consolechars -f lispm-8x14.psf

(For maximum effect, start an emacs and/or lisp session).

Reissue the instruction if -for instance after exiting the X
windows system- some lines seem to get lost to the bottom of
the screen (Ctrl-L can help there, too).

Additionally, using framebuffer one can try things like :
$ fbset 1024x768-90


Instructions for X
------------------

- Install

As root :

# mkdir -p /usr/local/share/fonts/bitmap/   # or any other dir
# cp FixedMediumLispm-13.pcf.gz /usr/local/share/fonts/bitmap/
(gunzip the font archive for other Unixen)
# cd /usr/local/share/fonts/bitmap/
# mkfontdir
# xset fp+ `pwd`

Add  /usr/local/share/fonts/bitmap/  to the fontpath list in
your XF86Config or xorg.conf file to avoid having to retype
xset fp+ /usr/local/share/fonts/bitmap/

- Use :

$ xterm -fn "-lispm-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

This 8x13 fixed font looks nice with resolutions around 800x600
For much higher ones try reverse video to enhance visibility :
$ xterm -bg grey -fg black -fn "-lispm-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

Under 1280x1024 this will look much like a lispm simulator :
$ xterm -bc -bcf 225 -bcn 250 -vb +mb -bg black -fg white -fn "-lispm-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" -geometry 96x69+300+60

For Emacs inside X, you can put this in your .emacs file :

(if window-system (progn
(create-fontset-from-fontset-spec
 "-lispm-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-fontset-lispm,
ascii:-lispm-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,
latin-iso8859-1:-lispm-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*,
latin-iso8859-15:-lispm-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*")
;; Now that the fontset has been defined, it can be invoked :
(set-default-font "fontset-lispm")
))

... but I would instead recommend to just launch *macs
with the modifier  -nw  from within the aforementioned xterm


BUGS

The font is both ascii-correct and ascii-complete, however...

-Not in the original :
	- A little serif at the tip of letters l and i
	(added later in the history of lisp machines)
	- Added many non-ascii chars, notably all accented letters.
	(for instance, we don't know how greek "mu" ever looked like
	on these machines. Seems it never got implemented)
-Not in the final font :
	The X font lacks all arrow signs, and both console and X fonts lack
	some non-ascii chars like "Yu-Shiang-Whole-Fish" (= greek gamma).
	This bug is inherent to the ISO encoding chosen.
